# treatwell-rectangle-generator
A simple rectangle generator. I use bootstrap for the nice form inputs, and vanilla javascript for rectangle generation. CSS/ HTML for the actual rectangles.

I've recently taught myself javascript, html and css, and also the newer technologies. I'm not exactly sure how to test the correctness of the rectangles, as they are just DIV's with css width and height attributes. I could have used Python and used AssertEqual in the unittest library, hard coding the result for comparison, and am happy to demonstrate if needed. :)
